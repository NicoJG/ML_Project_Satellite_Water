Well all of this was just playing around and trying what works and what does not work.

The Notebooks containing the procedures I will use are:
- Random_in_Europe.ipynb
- Water_check_pixel_coords.ipynb  
- Mapbox_download_images.ipynb

You need the following data for these notebooks to work:
- https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-0-countries/  
- https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-admin-0-countries/  
- token from Mapbox

The following data was used while trying things:
