# Notebooks containing the model building, training and evaluation  

Those notebooks were used with Google Colab and their GPU's for tensorflow.  

In order for those to work the dataset needs to be in a zip on your Google Drive.  
So a zip containing dataset/images/... must be at ML_Project_Satellite_Images/data/current_dataset.zip in your Google Drive.  

Most of those notebook are just trying out different things.

The final project was done with the notebooks 'final_model.ipynb','grid_search.ipynb' and 'grid_search_evaluate.ipynb' in the root folder.  

Outputs are deleted because of copyright reasons of the Mapbox images.
