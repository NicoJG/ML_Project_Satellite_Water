# Explaining the Data of the Project

Unfortunately, we cannot upload the data we used and collected while doing this project.  
This is because 1. we are not allowed to upload and redistribute any data we got from the Mapbox Services  
and 2. version controlling and uploading large amounts of data to GitHub is just not feasable.  

We have 3 different directories of data for this project:

| Directory | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| natural_earth | datasets downloaded from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) in particular the 10m and 110m countries data |
| dataset | the data used for machine learning, this is created during the project |
| dataset_metadata | additional data on the dataset such as all randomly drawn coordinates |
